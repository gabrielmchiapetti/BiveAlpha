    ## Removals
    - splashtexts.txt has been completely reset!
        - Because there is a new splashtext size, so i had to change it all
        - Way cooler splashtexts!

    - linecounter.py has been deleted
        - Due to it being fully useless

    - Music "alpha.mp3" has been removed
        - It was useless

    ## Variables and Functions
    - Now volume is correctly set for the default
        - Sound "cluckin.mp3" will play with default volume

    - Variables had their name changed:
        - screen to SCREEN

    - init_falling_blocks_title_screen(), update_falling_blocks_title_screen(), draw_falling_blocks_title_screen()
        - Had their name changed, removed the "_" and the "_title_screen"

    - terrain_gen_text_loading_screen was changed to current_terrain_gen_text
        - Due to it being changed a lot during the loading screen

    - splash_text_initial_rotation has been removed
        - All of its mentioning was changed to -20

    - Fixed unnecessary confusion with splashtexts fonts:
        - There were two variables:
            - font_splashtext (on config.py[was useless])
            - splashtext_font (on splashtexts.py[The right one])

            - They had different font sizes but were quite the same

            - So I deleted splashtext_font and the correct one now is font_splashtext on config.py

    - Added x_mouse and y_mouse for dealing with the clickable menu
        - On config.py
        - Good to notice most of the time they needed to be reset to update mouse position each frame

    - Removed the display_configuration variable on config.py
        - It was useless

    - More needed spacement added on config.py

    - Removed unnecessary comments on:
        - blocks.py
